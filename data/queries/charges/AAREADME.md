# Formal Charges
This directory contains queries that define formal charges applied to molecules.

These rules are from Fred Bruns, who worked at Lilly.

The rules actually applied are in the file [queries](queries). If you wish to use a subset
of the rules implemented, simply remove what you don't wish to use from that file.

These queries can inter-operate with the default Hydrogen Bond donor acceptor assignment
queries [hbonds](/data/queries/hbonds/AAREADME.md)
