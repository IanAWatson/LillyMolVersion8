# Hydrogen Bond Donors and Acceptors

These query files define the default LillyMol donor and acceptor rules.

These concepts are from Fred Bruns who worked at Lilly.

The convention adopted here is that atoms that are acceptors get isotope 1
and atoms that function as donors get isotope 3. There are also atoms which
can function as either acceptor or donor. These are marked with isotope 2.

There are several tools which use both the [Charge Assigner](/data/queries/charges/AAREADME.md)
and the donor acceptor assigner.
