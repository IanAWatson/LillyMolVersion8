Reductive Amination

This reaction demonstrates an important principle.

Although in the lab the reaction is performed as a multi-step process,
in Cheminformatics we can skip these intervening steps and implement
just the end-to-end transformation.

People from Organic Chemistry backgrounds often struggle with building
reaction files for this reason.
