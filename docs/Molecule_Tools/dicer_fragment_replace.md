# dicer_fragment_replace

This tool reads fragment files generated by dicer and can then use those
previously identified files to replace fragments in molecules, thereby
generating new molecules.

## Preamble
The first task is to generate one or more collections of diced molecules. Ideally these
should be molecules where you are fairly confident that the molecules have indeed
been made.

See [fragment_libraries](/docs/Workflows/fragment_libraries.md) for instructions on
how to extract fragments from collections in order to build the kinds of input files
needed by this tool.


## Generate New Molecules
With collections of fragments available, `dicer_fragment_replace` can
be used to generate new molecules.  It reads an input molecule,
together with a query that specifies a bond to be broken - or two
bonds if linkers are to be replaced. Atom typing must also be specified,
and it must match the atom typing used for creating the fragment library.
The bond is broken and the fragment is removed. The fragment library
is then searched for fragments whose attachment point(s) match the
atom type(s) of the residual atoms in the starting molecule.
