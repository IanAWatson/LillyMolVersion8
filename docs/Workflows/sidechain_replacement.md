# Sidechain Replacement

A common task in drug design is to replace a sidechain. This is usually driven
by a need to improve interactions with a protein, improve molecular properties,
improve I/P position, or other reasons.

While a *de-novo* tool can be used to suggest new sidechains, exploring known
chemistry first is often a good strategy. By replacing a problematic sidechain
with sidechains that have been observed in exemplified chemistry to exist in a
similar chemical environment, the likelihood of a viable molecule increases.

## Data
LillyMol comes with a file of aromatic sidechains extracted from a recent Chembl.
This [file](/data/chembl_sidechains.textproto) contains about 67k sidechains. It is
sorted by prevalence, so the first few records might be
```
[1OH]C iso: ATT smi: "[1OH]C" par: "CHEMBL232552" nat: 2 n: 561404 
F[1CH](F)F iso: ATT smi: "F[1CH](F)F" par: "CHEMBL15897" nat: 4 n: 360369 
C[1CH](C)C iso: ATT smi: "C[1CH](C)C" par: "CHEMBL1797277" nat: 4 n: 77121 
O[1CH]=O iso: ATT smi: "O[1CH]=O" par: "CHEMBL21708" nat: 3 n: 66808 
```
and unsurprisingly, the most frequent aromatic substituent in Chembl is
a methoxy - the isotopic atom indicates the attachment point. In this case
we see that there are 561404 examples in Chembl. The first molecule
that examplified this substituent was 'CHEMBL232552' but that will be
arbitrary. The 'nat' attribute is the number of atoms in the sidechain.

The maximum atom count in this file is 11, but that could be filtered via any of
the filtering tools in LillyMol - [fileconv](/docs/Molecule_Tools/fileconv.md)
or [molecule_filter](/docs/molecule_filter/molecule_filter.md).

## Simple Tool
In contrib/bin the tool [replace_sidechain](/contrib/bin/replace_sidechain.rb)
can be used to quickly perform either sidechain addition or sidechain replacement
using the substituents extracted from Chembl.

The default mode is to add every known substituent to each two connected aromatic
carbon atom - which will have an implicit Hydrogen.
```
replace_sidechain.sh file.smi > new.smi
```
This will however generate LARGE numbers of molecules. As a test, running
on 100 random molecules from Chembl produced about 9.7M products in just
over one minute.

The -support option allows specification of a minimum prevalence of the
reagents added. It is quite possible that some of the low prevalence
sidechains may be drawing errors.
```
replace_sidechain.sh -support 20 file.smi > new.smi
```
will result in about 6300 new substituents rather than the initial 67k.
There is no 'right' number. The lower the number, the greater the chance
of generating molecules that Chemists may disdain.

The -smarts1 option allows you to specify a smarts for those atoms to
which new substituents can be attached. By default that is a two
connected aromatic carbon, with an implicit Hydrogen, and the two
adjacent ring atoms are also 2 connected - to avoid creating "crodwed"
substitution patterns. Adjust to taste...

Note that the default smarts restricts sites to aromatic carbon atoms.
Adjust if you wish to allow [nH] type atoms to be used, but beware
that this will introduce products with n-N bonds, which may be
undesirable.

### Sidechain Replacement
If you with to remove an existing sidechain, that is necessarily more
complex. The tool has a default smarts, which is a three connected aromatic
carbon attached to a sidechain with fewer than 10 heavy atoms. The existing
sidechain is removed and the replacement inserted.

```
replace_sidechain.sh -smarts2 def -support 10 -v file.smi > new.smi
```
will do that. Again, if you have specific requirements for the sidechain(s)
to be removed enter those via the -smarts2 option.
```
replace_sidechain.sh -smarts2 '[$(c:a:cO[CH3])]-!@[R0]' -support 10 -v file.smi > new.smi
```
will remove all existing sidechains that are meta to a methoxy 'O[CH3]'. Note that
the bond to be broken must be the first two atoms in the smarts. If you want more
flexibility, build a reaction file - this tool calls trxn with a custom
reaction file.

replace_sidechain.sh provides a quick and relatively easy-to-use means
of quickly generating significant numbers of likely plausible new molecules.
Generally either the sidechains used, and/or the products generated should be filtered
for desirable properties, fileconv, tsubstructure, molecule_filter, iwdescr, models...

# More Complex Case Study
The most common sidechain replacement is something attached to an aromatic ring.

The first task would be to extract all known aromatic substituents from all
sources at your disposal. In this case we restrict this to Chembl, but in general
more sources should be used. 

For this exercise we choose a random molecule from Chembl, CHEMBL3958656

![CHEMBL3958656](Images/CHEMBL3958656.png) 

and we wish to replace the
-N-phenyl-F group attached to the pyrazole ring at the 3 position.

In order to maximise the probability that our replacement sidechains can be
made, look for sidechains that have been observed attached to such a position in
Chembl. Insist that the fragment have a Fluorine or Nitrogen atom. Note that
by default the `-f` option matches as an **or** condition. If you want it
to match as an **and** condition, add the `-a` option, but that will
necessarily reduce the number of fragments found.
```
time get_substituents.sh -S substituent.textproto -n -s '[nr5]1nc(cc1)' -O 2 -m  5 -M 12 -f F -f '[#7]' -I 1 -z i -v chembl.smi
```
which takes 60 seconds to run and reports
```
Read 2213922 molecules

```

Note that we have placed an isotopic labe of 1 on the matched atom
that will be attached to the core of Chembl

The file created `substituent.textproto` is a variant on a protcol buffer
textproto form (it has a leading smiles string). It might look like (after sorting on column 11)
```
Fc1cc[1cH]cc1 iso: ATT smi: "Fc1cc[1cH]cc1" par: "CHEMBL501070" nat: 7 n: 981 
[n]1cc[1cH]cc1 iso: ATT smi: "[n]1cc[1cH]cc1" par: "CHEMBL570872" nat: 6 n: 431

```
The first sidechain is derived from CHEMBL501070, has 7 heavy atoms and there
are 981 occurrences of that sidechain in Chembl. This is the highest count, and
clearly using this as a replacement would be very low risk in terms of synthetic
feasibility.

The last one listed above has only 1 instance, and would therefore be is potentially
higher risk of sythetic difficulties. Of course at this stage, we have no
idea how these particular fragments might actually work for the intended purpose.

Note that at this point, the sidechains retrieved should be further examined
and filtered. It is a small set and any filtering will be very fast.

## Enumeration
With isotopically labelled replacement sidechains available, produce (by hand,
or use the `-Y rmatom=smarts` option in fileconv)
an isotopically labelled version of our starting molecule.

![start](Images/CHEMBL3958656_mod.png)

The reaction file needed is very simple.
```
scaffold {
  id: 0
  smarts: "[1]"
}
sidechain {
  id: 1
  smarts: "[1]"
  join {
    a1: 0
    a2: 0
    btype: SS_SINGLE_BOND
  }
}
```
merely joining isotope 1 in the scaffold with isotope 1 in the sidechain via a single bond.
For those more comfortable with smirks,
```
trxn.sh -K '[1:1].[1:2]>>[1:1]-[1:2]' 
```
yields the same result.

## Analysis
If the file from `get_substituents` was used unchanged, there are a bunch of
extra columns in the output. Strip to what is of interest and sort the results
```
iwcut.sh -f 1,7,11 trxn.smi | sort -k 3,3gr | sed -e 's/"//g' > replaced.smi
```
Fetch the top 20 and draw aligned png's with CACTVS's `csib`.
```
csib -atomcolor type -footerproperty E_NAME -height 600 -width 800 -format png -template 'n1ncc(c1)C(=O)N' -templatealign redraw CHEMBL3958656_replaced.smi
```
In each of the images included here, the first token of the footer is the name of
the starting molecule, then the name of the `donor` molecule that provided the
first example of this sidechain, and finally the number of such instances in
Chembl.

Note that indeed each sidechain does have either a Nitrogen atom, and/or a
Fluorine.

Remember, these examples are presented based on prevalence only, not
for any suitability for any particular purpose. In a real world
experiment, these molecules would be extensively filtered to ensure
that they had desirable properties, plausible arrangements of
atoms, did not violate structural filters, etc...

## Conclusion
With just a few commands it is possible to quickly come up with 
topologically plausible *de-novo* generated molecules. And of course
one could simultaneously replace two sidechains by using each
of these generated molecules as a starting point to replace a different sidechain.

In any quest for improved properties via sidechain replacement
starting with known examples may be an efficient and effective means
of exploring plausible structure space. Only after this simple and
cheap approach is applied should more expensive, complex and risky
approaches be applied.

There is of course no guarantee that viable results will emerge, but that
will be true of any method.
